## 1. What this figure shows

This figure presents a Pearson correlation heatmap among multiple plant functional traits (leaf, twig, stem, and bark traits).\
The color scale reflects the strength and direction of correlations:

-   **Dark red** → strong positive correlation\
-   **Light yellow/orange** → weak or no correlation

The dendrograms (top and left) result from hierarchical clustering, grouping traits that covary similarly across species.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Main trait clusters (biological interpretation)

### 🔹 Cluster 1 — Leaf nutrient economics

**Includes:** - Leaf P content\
- Leaf N:P ratio\
- Leaf C:N ratio\
- Leaf C content\
- Specific leaf area (SLA)

**Interpretation:**\
This cluster represents the Leaf Economics Spectrum (LES). High SLA and nutrient-rich leaves are associated with fast resource acquisition, whereas high C:N and C:P ratios indicate conservative strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔹 Cluster 2 — Twig and stem nutrient traits

**Includes:** - Twig N content\
- Twig P content\
- Stem N content\
- Stem P content

**Interpretation:**\
Nutrient concentrations in woody organs are strongly coordinated, indicating a whole-plant nutrient allocation strategy rather than organ-specific control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔹 Cluster 3 — Stoichiometric ratios (C:N, C:P, N:P)

**Includes:** - Twig C:N and C:P ratios\
- Stem C:N and C:P ratios

**Interpretation:**\
Stoichiometric ratios cluster together across organs, showing that nutrient limitation signals (N vs P limitation) are consistent at the whole-plant level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔹 Cluster 4 — Structural investment traits

**Includes:** - Leaf dry matter content\
- Twig dry matter content\
- Bark dry matter content\
- Bark thickness

**Interpretation:**\
These traits describe carbon allocation to structure and defense, reflecting slow-growth, stress-tolerant strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Cross-organ coordination

-   Leaf, twig, stem, and bark traits do not form isolated groups.\
-   Instead, traits cluster by function (nutrient economy vs structural investment) rather than by organ.

**This indicates integrated plant strategies rather than independent organ behavior.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Key ecological message

The correlation heatmap reveals strong coordination among plant functional traits across organs, structured along two main axes:

1.  **Nutrient acquisition and stoichiometry**\
2.  **Structural investment and tissue density**

These axes correspond to well-established ecological frameworks such as the Leaf Economics Spectrum and whole-plant resource-use strategies.

## Figure 1 — Stem & Leaf nutrient concentrations and tissue density

These figures are pairwise trait‐correlation matrices, split by plant organ (leaf, twig, bark, stem) and forest type (colors: typically conserved vs disturbed forests). Each panel shows:

-   Diagonal: trait distributions (density plots) for the two forest types\
-   Lower triangle: scatterplots + fitted trend (separate by forest type)\
-   Upper triangle: Pearson correlation (r) with significance (*, **,*** )\
-   Colored text = correlations within each forest type

### Main patterns

1.  Stem dry matter content ↔ stem tissue density
    -   Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.81)\
    -   Interpretation: denser stems have more dry matter → structural investment strategy
2.  Leaf N ↔ Leaf P content
    -   Very strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.82)\
    -   Classic leaf economics spectrum: nutrient-rich leaves are coordinated
3.  Leaf C vs N/P
    -   Weak to moderately negative correlations\
    -   Carbon-rich leaves tend to be nutrient poorer, reflecting trade-off between structure and metabolism
4.  Forest-type effect
    -   Disturbed forests often show slightly higher nutrient concentrations and wider distributions\
    -   Suggests faster-growth strategies under disturbance

### Ecological takeaway

Stem traits reflect mechanical strategy, leaf traits reflect metabolic strategy, and these are only weakly coupled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 2 — Twig & Bark physical traits

### Main patterns

1.  Twig dry matter ↔ twig tissue density
    -   Strong positive (r ≈ 0.65)\
    -   Denser twigs = more conservative growth
2.  Bark thickness ↔ bark density
    -   Moderate negative correlation\
    -   Thick bark tends to be less dense, typical of fire or disturbance protection strategies
3.  Twig traits ↔ bark traits
    -   Generally positive correlations\
    -   Indicates whole-plant structural coordination
4.  Forest differences
    -   Disturbed forests show higher variance and steeper slopes\
    -   Indicates trait plasticity under stress/disturbance

### Ecological takeaway

Twig and bark traits scale together as part of a defensive/structural syndrome, especially important under disturbance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 3 — Twig nutrient content & stoichiometry

### Main patterns

1.  Twig P content ↔ C:P ratio
    -   Strong negative correlation (r ≈ −0.76)\
    -   Mathematical + biological: more P → lower C:P → higher nutrient availability
2.  C:N ↔ C:P ratios
    -   Positive correlation\
    -   Species with conservative nutrient use are conservative across elements
3.  N:P ratio ↔ C:N / C:P
    -   Negative correlations\
    -   Reflects nutrient limitation gradients (N vs P limitation)
4.  Bark C content
    -   Weak correlations → bark is more structural & inert

### Ecological takeaway

Twig chemistry strongly reflects nutrient limitation strategies, while bark chemistry is relatively decoupled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 4 — Leaf stoichiometry & twig nutrients

### Main patterns

1.  Leaf C:N ↔ leaf C:P
    -   Very strong positive (r ≈ 0.81)\
    -   Strongly coordinated nutrient economics
2.  Leaf N:P ↔ leaf C:P
    -   Positive → confirms P limitation signal
3.  Twig N ↔ leaf N:P
    -   Negative correlation\
    -   Higher twig N corresponds to less P limitation in leaves
4.  Forest differences
    -   Disturbed forests cluster toward lower C:N and C:P\
    -   Indicates acquisitive nutrient strategy

### Ecological takeaway

Leaves are the best indicators of nutrient limitation and productivity strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 5 — Leaf morphology & economics

### Main patterns

1.  Specific leaf area (SLA) ↔ leaf dry matter content
    -   Strong negative correlation (r ≈ −0.67)\
    -   Core Leaf Economics Spectrum
2.  Leaf area ↔ SLA
    -   Positive correlation\
    -   Large leaves tend to be thinner and resource-acquisitive
3.  Leaf thickness ↔ tissue density
    -   Positive but weaker\
    -   Two independent ways to increase structural investment
4.  Forest differences
    -   Disturbed forests show higher SLA and lower tissue density\
    -   Indicates fast-growth, short-lived leaves

### Ecological takeaway

This figure perfectly captures the fast–slow leaf economics axis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 6 — Bark nutrient stoichiometry

### Main patterns

1.  Bark N ↔ bark P
    -   Moderate positive correlation\
    -   Coordinated nutrient storage
2.  C:N & C:P ratios ↔ N/P contents
    -   Strong negative correlations\
    -   Stoichiometry dominated by nutrient dilution
3.  N:P ratio ↔ C:P ratio
    -   Strong positive (r ≈ 0.74)\
    -   Indicates P limitation signal even in bark
4.  Forest-type effect
    -   Disturbed forests tend to lower C:N and C:P\
    -   More nutrient-rich bark

### Ecological takeaway

Bark, though structural, still reflects long-term nutrient strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 7 — Stem nutrient content & stoichiometry

### Main patterns

1.  Stem N ↔ stem P
    -   Strong positive (r ≈ 0.44)\
    -   Coordinated nutrient allocation
2.  Stem C:N ↔ stem N content
    -   Strong negative (r ≈ −0.90)\
    -   Carbon dilution effect
3.  C:P ↔ N:P ratios
    -   Strong positive\
    -   Reflects integrated nutrient limitation
4.  Forest differences
    -   Disturbed forests show higher nutrient contents and lower stoichiometric ratios

### Ecological takeaway

Stem chemistry integrates long-term nutrient availability and growth strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## BIG PICTURE

Traits cluster into three coordinated axes:

1\. Structural investment (density, dry matter)\
2. Nutrient economics (N, P, stoichiometry)\
3. Growth strategy (SLA, leaf area)

Disturbed forests consistently show higher nutrient contents, lower C:N and C:P ratios, and higher SLA → faster, more acquisitive strategies.
